-- The keybind setup is weird because:
-- - The plugin defines its own mappings.
-- - The plugin documentation is not clear enough and I could not understand which function to call in a custom mappings of my own.
-- - I want to lazy load this plugin when the mapping is used.

local keybinding = "ga"

return {
    "echasnovski/mini.align",
    version = "*",
    opts = {
        mappings = {
            start_with_preview = keybinding,
            start = nil,
        },
        -- Default behavior.
        options = {
            split_pattern = " ",
            justify_side = "left",
            merge_delimiter = "",
        },
    },
    -- Doesn't work as I would like.
    keys = {
        {
            keybinding,
            mode = { "v" },
            desc = "Align text",
