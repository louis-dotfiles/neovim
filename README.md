# Neovim configuration

This is my Neovim configuration written in Lua to get an "IDE-like" experience
without too many bells and whistles.


## Features

Langage server protocol (LSP): get errors and warning while you code, not when
you compile or run your code.

Editing support functions:

- Add/remove/change surrounding "pairs" like `{}`, `()`, `''` ...
- Alignment / tabulation.
- Split / join lists (e.g. import statements).
- Comment code.
- LSP related:
  - Code completion and snippets.
  - LSP signature popup while typing function calls.
  - Rename functions and variables.
  - Code actions.
  - Go to refererences.
  - Go to definition.
- Color codes preview.
- Additional text objects like "arguments" ...

Easily find files, by name or content with `:Telescope`. And much more!

Pay a visit to the [User_manual.md](./User_manual.md) documentation to learn
more.


## Installation prerequisites

**Neovim version >= 0.10.0**.

Neovim itself doesn't need any additional programs to be installed and work,
but to enjoy the full potential of the additional plugins (particularly LSP),
you will need the following:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). I recommend using
  [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm).
- [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) (the Rust package manager).
- Some sort of C compiler (e.g. gcc).
- Additional binaries: `fd`, `ripgrep`, `node` (use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm)).


## Installation

All you have to do is clone this repository in `~/.config/nvim`, i.e.
[~/.config/nvim/init.lua](~/.config/nvim/init.lua) should be [this
file](./init.lua).

Upon first starting Neovim, the configuration will:

1. Download the package manager.
1. In turn the package manager will download all configured plugins.
1. Treesitter (one of the plugins) will download the configured language
   highlighting configurations.

Once this is done you should manually install the language servers you need /
want / are configured. See
[CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md##lsp-configuration).


## Is everything ok?

Running `:checkhealth` can give you some insight into what might be broken /
missing. Take some time to review potential errors and warnings (warning
usually aren't critical and most can safely be ignored).
